/**
 * Democracy Score Calculator
 * 
 * Measures how democratic a community's governance is on a 0-100 scale.
 * 
 * Higher score = more democratic (horizontal governance, minimal admin intervention)
 * Lower score = more centralized (admin-heavy, opaque decision-making)
 * 
 * The score is calculated from multiple factors, each weighted differently.
 * It's a reputational mechanism — not a hard limit, but an early warning system.
 * 
 * Factors considered:
 * 1. Admin action frequency (negative weight)
 * 2. Sortition usage (positive weight)
 * 3. Member participation rate (positive weight)
 * 4. Transparency of decisions (positive weight)
 * 5. Proposal success rate (positive weight)
 * 6. Amendment adoption rate (positive weight)
